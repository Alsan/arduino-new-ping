= Using NewPing (Syntax) =

  * *`NewPing sonar(trigger_pin, echo_pin [, max_cm_distance]);`* - Initialize an ultrasonic device, trigger pin, echo pin, and [optional] maximum distance you wish to sensor to measure (default = 500cm).


  * *`sonar.ping();`* - Send a ping and get the echo time (in microseconds) as a result. 
  * *`sonar.ping_in();`* - Send a ping and get the distance in whole inches.
  * *`sonar.ping_cm();`* - Send a ping and get the distance in whole centimeters.
  * *`sonar.convert_in(echoTime);`* - Convert echoTime from microseconds to inches.
  * *`sonar.convert_cm(echoTime);`* - Convert echoTime from microseconds to centimeters.


  * *`sonar.ping_timer(function);`* - Send a ping and call function to test if ping is complete.
  * *`sonar.check_timer();`* - Check if ping has returned within the set distance limit.

  * *`NewPing::timer_us(frequency, function);`* - Call function every frequency microseconds.
  * *`NewPing::timer_ms(frequency, function);`* - Call function every frequency milliseconds.
  * *`NewPing::timer_stop();`* - Stop the timer.
